## Primary Cross-Industry Use Cases

### 1. Agricultural & Farm Equipment

Commonly used for:

- Tractors
- Irrigation pumps
- Diesel generators
- Remote field refueling

Design considerations:
- Chemical resistance to diesel
- UV stability in outdoor storage
- Safe manual handling

---

### 2. Lawn & Landscaping Equipment

Portable fuel tanks are used in:

- Commercial lawn mower fleets
- Mobile landscaping crews
- Grounds maintenance contractors

Advantages:
- Compact storage
- Easy vehicle transport
- Controlled manual pumping

---

### 3. Automotive & Off-Road Vehicles

Applications include:

- ATVs
- Off-road vehicles
- Emergency roadside fuel supply
- Overlanding setups

Important factors:
- Leak-resistant structure
- Impact resistance
- Secure hose storage

---

### 4. Marine & Dockside Refueling

Beyond permanent onboard tanks, portable systems are used for:

- Emergency dockside fueling
- Auxiliary supply for small boats
- Temporary fuel transfer operations

---

## Engineering Considerations

When used across industries, the following factors must be evaluated:

- HDPE wall thickness (typically 2 mm)
- Blow-molded structural integrity
- Manual pump efficiency
- Hose compatibility
- Fuel compatibility (gasoline, diesel, kerosene)

---

## Conclusion

Cross-industry adoption of HDPE portable marine fuel tanks is driven by structural durability, transport convenience, and multi-liquid compatibility.
