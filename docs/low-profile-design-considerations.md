## Design Objectives

Low profile marine fuel tanks are designed for compact storage in small boats and confined compartments. The primary design priorities include:

- Space optimization under seats or in lockers
- Stability in low-center-of-gravity installations
- Vibration resistance for small outboard engines
- Safe manual handling and transport

---

## Typical Capacity Range

Common capacity configurations:

- 12L portable tank
- 24L extended runtime tank

These sizes are widely used in small fishing boats, tenders, inflatables, and deck boats.
