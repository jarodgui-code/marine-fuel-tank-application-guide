## Overview

Movable marine fuel tanks on wheels are designed for high-capacity portable refueling in dockside, marina, agricultural, and field environments.

Typical capacity: 50L–60L (14–16 gallons)

These systems combine HDPE blow-molded tanks with integrated wheels, handles, and manual or electric transfer pumps.

## Core Design Features

### 1. Integrated Mobility System
- Molded-in axle support
- Heavy-duty wheels
- Ergonomic handle design
- Balanced center of gravity

Mobility is engineered to allow a single operator to transport a full tank safely.

---

### 2. Fuel Transfer Control

- Manual pump or siphon system
- Anti-spill nozzle
- Flow control valve
- Venting mechanism

Proper venting prevents pressure imbalance during transfer.

---

### 3. Structural Reinforcement

- Ribbed HDPE shell
- Impact-resistant corners
- UV-stabilized material
- Blow-molded one-piece construction

HDPE offers corrosion resistance in saltwater environments.

## Typical Marine Use Scenarios

- Dockside refueling for outboard boats
- Emergency fuel supply at marinas
- Tender boat refueling
- Small yacht support

---

## Cross-Industry Usage

Movable tanks are also used in:

- Farm equipment refueling
- Landscaping fleet operations
- Generator fueling
- Off-road vehicles (ATV / UTV)

---

## Engineering Evaluation Factors

When selecting movable HDPE marine fuel tanks, consider:

- Wheel durability under full load
- Handle structural reinforcement
- Hose compatibility (gasoline / diesel)
- Compliance with marine fuel standards
- Anti-static grounding requirements

---

## Summary

Movable marine fuel tanks improve refueling flexibility while maintaining structural integrity and fuel safety.

They are suitable for both marine and industrial portable fueling applications.
