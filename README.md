## Core Application Areas

### Marine Applications
HDPE marine fuel tanks are widely used for:
- Outboard engine boats
- Yachts and tenders
- Fishing boats and deck boats

Marine-grade design prioritizes fuel compatibility, vibration resistance, and controlled fuel transfer in wet and corrosive environments.

---

### Off-Road & Vehicle-Mounted Use
Portable HDPE fuel tanks are commonly carried on:
- Off-road vehicles
- Overland platforms
- Motorcycles and utility vehicles

In these scenarios, the tank functions strictly as an auxiliary fuel container for transport and controlled transfer, not as a permanent vehicle fuel system.

---

### Farm, Lawn & Equipment Use
Marine-derived fuel tanks are increasingly adopted for:
- Lawn mowers
- Tractors and agricultural machinery
- Generators and pumps

Compared to consumer gas cans, HDPE tanks offer better durability, stability, and spill control in daily work environments.

---

### Home & Emergency Fuel Transfer
For residential and light commercial users, HDPE fuel tanks are used as:
- Backup fuel supply for generators
- Emergency fuel transfer containers
- Workshop and maintenance refuelling systems

Sealed construction and chemical resistance make them suitable for temporary storage and controlled dispensing.
